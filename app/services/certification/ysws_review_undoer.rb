module Certification
  # Reverses a completed YSWS review so it lands back in the pending queue, and
  # removes the review's Airtable submission record.
  #
  # This is the inverse of Admin::Certification::YswsController#complete: it
  # clears every field that decision stamped, drops the claim so the review is
  # up for grabs again, and deletes the row the sync job upserted into the YSWS
  # Project Submission table. Devlog verdicts are deliberately left alone — the
  # reviewer's per-devlog work survives so the review can simply be completed
  # again.
  #
  # Returned reviews are out of scope: #return_to_ship_cert also opens a recert
  # Certification::Ship and transfers the external certification id to it, and
  # undoing the returned_at stamp alone would leave the project sitting in both
  # queues at once.

  # up there, that downstream record has to be removed by hand — the record id
  # is reported back on the Result so the caller can log it before it's gone.
